The <cloud> element is deprecated in favor of the <mesh>.
See the mesh example under examples/zoo/mesh.

If you already have a <cloud>, you should convert it to use
the <mesh> element.  For example,

 <cloud>
    <about>
        <label>cloud (deprecated)</label>
    </about>
    <dim>2</dim>
    <units>m</units>
    <hide>yes</hide>
    <points>
       0.0 0.0
       ...
    </points>
 </cloud>

should be converted to 

 <mesh>
    <about>
        <label>cloud in unstructured mesh</label>
    </about>
    <dim>2</dim>
    <units>m</units>
    <hide>yes</hide>
    <unstructured>
        <points>
 	  0.0 0.0
          ...
        </points>
    </unstructured>
 </mesh>

Please note that a cloud should be used when your output has no geometry (it's
really just a cloud of points).  If your output contains a mesh that has a
geometry (for example, a uniform grid) use that mesh.  The mesh generated from
a cloud of points may be very different what your tool produced.

See the mesh documentation for more information.

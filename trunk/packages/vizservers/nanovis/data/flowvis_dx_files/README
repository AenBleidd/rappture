note from Matieu Luisier (04/13/2007) regarding data inside of vector files which can be used for flowvis testing:

I created 2 files for the nanoVis guys, Layer_Matrix.dat and Id.dat. The structure is a 2.1 x 2.1 x 32 nm3 Si nanowire with Vds=Vgs=0.6 V. There are NA=7680 atoms in the file

1) Layer_Matrix is a NA x 8 matrix whose 3 first columns contain the x, y, and z coordinates of each atom respectively, the 4th column the type of the atom (not relevant here), and the 4 last columns are the four nearest-neighbors. For example Layer_Matrix(113,:) is equal to

0.4072 1.2217 0.1358 1 145 0 0 77

This means that atom 113 is situated at (x,y,z)=(0.4072,1.2217,0.1358), it is of type 1 and it has 2 neighbors, atom 145 (bond 1), and atom 77 (bond 4).

2) Id is a NA x 4 matrix and contains the value of the current along the 4 bonds that starts from each atom. For example, Id(113,:) is equal to

-0.4848e-7 0 0 0.4848e-7

This means that current flows from atom 113 to atom 145 along bond 1 with a value of -0.4848e-7 (A) and from atom 113 to atom 77 along bond 4 with a value of 0.4848e7. Due to current conservation, the current that arrives to an atom is the same as the current that leaves an atom.

#  COMPONENT: interface - used in the main program of a simulator
#
#  Rappture.interface() is called at the start of a simulator.  You pass
#  in arguments and one or more interface packages.  If the -gui flag
#  is included, then the interfaces are loaded and interrogated, and
#  interface() writes out a tool.xml file, then invokes the Rappture GUI
#  to collect input.  The Rappture GUI writes out a driver.xml file,
#  and then invokes this tool again with the -driver flag to process
#  the input.

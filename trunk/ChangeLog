2008-12-10: Rappture 20081205 released

2008-11-25:

 * Fixed sequenceviewer to handle sequences for heightmaps (surface plots)
   properly.  Rappture was defaulting to VTK and segfaulting.
 * Added keyboard and mousewheel bindings for zooms in nanovisviewer,
   heightmapviewer, and molvisviewer.
 * Added panning function to nanovisviewer, heightmapviewer, and
   molvisviewer.  Feature available via mouse and keyboard.
 * Fixed pymolproxy to handle non-blocking reads from pymol server where
   previous client command would drain stdout.  The bug appears in
   64-bit versions.
 * Changed curve object to use a vector to read/parse xy data and then
   split into the corresponding x and y vectors.  Rough testing shows
   to be 8x faster than split/scan-ing every line.  This was also done
   for fields (points).
 * Added feature to VisViewer base class to disconnect from the render
   server after a specified interval "idleTimeout_".  If zero, no
   timeout is set.  This affects molvisviewer, heightmapviewer, and
   nanovisviewer.  The viewers will reconnect on the next read or write
   request to the server.  See _CheckConnection method.
 * Fixed molvisviewer to properly set screen dimensions when reconnecting
   to the pymol server.  This caused the object to be scaled and shifted
   improperly.
 * Fixed nanovisviewer to properly reset screen dimensions and rotation
   angles when reconnecting to the nanovis server.
 * Extended color set (8 to 32) of automatic colors for xy graphs.
 * Removed load-balancing feature from nanoscale.  It always returns
   0.0.0.0 (no redirect).
 * Added isunirect2d to field object.  This is a cleaner way of determining
   whether to connect to a nanovis server or use VTK.
 * Fixed -imagecmd in htmlviewer.tcl.  Added _freeImage method/callback.
   The htmlwidget was destroying the cached icon images.
 * Added recolor option the XyLegend object.  It recolors all the selected
   traces.
 * Removed split $params(-load) from driver.
 * Added "list" type to getopts.tcl to allow for command line
   specifications like "rappture -load file1 file2 file3".  The list
   type can only be used at the end of the command line.
 * Added rappture-csh.env script for c-shell users.
 * Fixed lang/matlab/Makefile.in to prevent parallel builds of
   matlab bindings.  "mex" generates temporary files that collide when
   multiple compilations are using the same directory.
 * Added -x flag to nanoscale to automatically rotate between screens
   as new requests are made.
 * Added separate method in nanovis NvCamera.h to handle camera eye and 
   target positions (for panning).
 * Added pan call to nanovis.
 * Added checks to nanovis for valid framebuffer objects.
 * Fixed packages/vizservers/nanovis/Makefile.in to allow parallel builds.
 * Added xunits, yunits, and zunits attributes for unirect2d data.
 * Added statistics generation for nanovis and pymolproxy servers. Writes
   to /var/tmp/visservers/data.xml.
 * Added MCR_INHIBIT_CTF_LOCK flag to the compiled matlab patch file to
   prevent matlab from trying to create a lock on CTF file.
 * Added copy feature to loaders. Copy feature allows users to specify where
   to put data from xml files loaded from the examples directory. See
   rappture/examples/lang/tcl/loadercopy for sample use.
 * Added compiled matlab example to rappture/examples/app-fermi/matlab 
   currently only for 32bit, if using on 64bit, need to adjust patch file.
 * Fix allowing enabled tabs (groups within groups), which are a part of a
   list of tabs, to show the correct information when one or more tabs
   before them are disabled.
 * Reorganize command line options for simsim
 * Added autolabel to number and integer outputs, but everyone should still
   put labels on all outputs.
 * Allow the contents of a note to be dynamically changed, for example
   through a loader.
 * Added xmldiff to find the difference between two rappture xml files.
 * Added -nosim flag to rerun so it works as it did in previous releases.
   Currently, rerun is strictly for viewing old run.xml files.
 * Updating rappture to allow for loading of old run.xml files using the
   -load flag. This feature differs from rerun in that if rappture can find
   where the tool was installed, it will allow you to continue running
   simulations.
 * Added bohrs to the units test cases

2008-10-10: nanovis 20081010 released
2008-09-26: nanovis 20080926 released
2008-09-26: Rappture 20080924 released

 * Added stats collection to nanovis

2008-09-09: Rappture 20080909 released

 * Created legend for xy plots.  You can raise/lower/show/hide/rename
   traces (curves).  There is also a provision for displaying the
   fill area between two curves and taking the average of two or
   more curves.
 * Nanovis markers now change the transfer function globally. Previously
   changing the a marker changes the transfer function for that volume
   only.  Now all volumes using that transfer function are affected.
 * Pymolproxy changed to use file transfer for PDB files.  This should 
   prevent large datasets from breaking pymol.
 * Data sent to render servers now made in one write. Should improve
   performance for large datasets.
 * Nanovis server was profiled and improvements made to protocol.
 * "Abort" button fixed.  Previous version abort was disabled during
   simulation.
 * New checkbutton indicator for booleanentry (switch).
 * Empty sequences (pymol) are now checked.
 * Fixed heightmap (surface plot) grid to accurately measure the surface.
 * added bohr units and conversion to meters
 * added a free text label so users can label each element of a sequence.
 * added example using Ruby's Rappture bindings.
 * changed boolean widget to use a simple checkbutton 
 * added ability to set the color of integer and number widgets
   to a wavelength or range of wavelengths.
 * fixed bug in Ruby putfile() method (bhaley)

2008-03-31: nanovis 20080331 released
2008-03-30: Rappture 20080330 released

 * added initial bindings and build scripts for Ruby (bhaley)

    <h2> Rosenbrock Function UQ Test</h2>
    <p>  The Rosenbrock function is commonly used for testing optimization and uncertainty quantification software.  The form we will use is</p>
    <p>
    f(x,y) = 100*(y-x**2)**2 + (1-x)**2
    <p>
    This is a fourth order polynomial and its response surface looks like this:
    <p>

    <p>
    UQ software should be able to build close approximations to this response surface given enough sample points.  Our "Smolyak" method will reproduce
    this response exactly with a level 4 run.

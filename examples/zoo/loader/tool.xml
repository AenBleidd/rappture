  <about>Example of a Rappture &lt;loader&gt; object.

A loader is used to load values into the interface from example files.  The example files have the same format as the tool.xml file that they are being loaded into.  In fact, they can be generated by running the tool and saving the output run.xml file.  In you look in the example files, you'll see that each one also has an &lt;about&gt; section with a label and a description.  These show up in the loader control.

The description appears in a tooltip when you hover over the loader control with your mouse.

You can see the real action here by selecting various examples from the loader.  The simulate button doesn't do very much.  It just copies the inputs to the output log.

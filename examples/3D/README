This is a brief example of using the rerun program and the 3D 
capabilities within Rappture.

In this example, the file 3d_test_run.xml is a run file generated 
by the Rappture GUI some time ago from a tool called Prophet.

For more information on Prophet check out 

http://www.nanohub.org/simulation_tools/prophet_tool_information

To use the rerun program type
    % rerun 3d_test_run.xml

Since rerun's purpose is to revisualize data from previously run
input, changing the simulation parameters will not effect the
data that will be displayed in the rerun simulator. Therefore
you should proceed in clicking the "Simulate" button to see the
stored graphs, outputs, and data.

To compile the Rappture Library, the following must be done:

1)  Adjust the Makefile.

    Change Makefile variables as needed. Pay particular attention to
    compilers, CFLAGS, directory names, and where python components
    are located. Make sure you change the variable 'EMB_PY_FLAGS' 
    to point to the location of the python shared (or static) object
    library is located. It can be placed in the lib directory directly
    above this directory.

    Check the Following variables:
        
        PY_SRC_HEADERS  = /opt/rappture/include/python2.4
        EMB_PY_LIB_FLAG = -lpython2.4
        EMB_PY_LIB_DIR  = /opt/rappture/lib

        # tell make where to find the libscew sources
        SCEW_HEADERS    = /opt/rappture/include/scew
        LIB_SCEW_INCL   = -I $(SCEW_HEADERS)
        LIB_SCEW_FLAG   = -L/opt/rappture/lib -lscew

        # define the top of our directory structure
        # replace this with the full path of the directory
        # containing the rappture directory
        TOP_DIR

        CFLAGS          

2) Make the Rappture library

    To make the Rappture Library, you will need to make sure the Scew
    library header files are installed and the makefile variable
    SCEW_HEADERS is properly defined. The following scew related header 
    files must be available in the library search path, preferably in 
    same directory as the scew header files.

     |  Header File Name  |   Provider   | 
    -+--------------------+--------------+-
     |   xelement.h       | scew source  | 
     |   xattribute.h     | scew source  | 
     |   xerror.h         | scew source  | 
    -+--------------------|--------------+- 
     |   attribute.h      | scew source  | 
     |   element.h        | scew source  |
     |   error.h          | scew source  | 
     |   parser.h         | scew source  |
     |   scew.h           | scew source  |
     |   str.h            | scew source  | 
     |   tree.h           | scew source  |
     |   writer.h         | scew source  |
    -+--------------------+--------------+-
     |   expat.h          | expat source |
     |   expat_external.h | expat source |
    -+--------------------+--------------+-

    Once You've verified that these header files are available, 
    issue the following commands:
        cd rappture/src
        make 

3)  Installing Python's Rappture.Units module.
        cd rappture/python
        python setup.py install

4)  Make the Rappture Test programs
        cd rappture/test
        make

To compile the Rappture Library, the following must be done:

1) Adjust the Makefile.

    Change Makefile variables as needed. Pay particular attention to
    compilers, CFLAGS, directory names, and where python components
    are located. Make sure you change the variable 'EMB_PY_FLAGS' 
    to point to the location of the python shared (or static) object
    library is located. It can be placed in the lib directory directly
    above this directory.

2) Adjust the file 'include/cee/rappture_interface.h'

    Line 1 of rappture_interface.h includes 'python2.4/Python.h'.
    Make sure this file (and all of its supporting files) exist
    in the directory 'include/cee/'. Replace 'python2.4/Python.h'
    with the version of python being used and the location where
    Python.h can be found. Python.h and all of its suppoting files
    can be downloaded from http://www.python.org/download/. You
    will only need the header files to fulfill this task.
    If you do not have a python object library, you will need to
    compile python with the appropriate flags (--enable-shared) to
    get it. 
    
3) Make sure the Rappture module is installed in Python.

4) Make a library
    
    make librappture

#  rerun
#
#  script to view the output of a previously created run.xml file.
#  this is just a wrapper around the "rappture -load ..." command
#  you can use this command to load and compare run.xml files from
#  the same application. loading xml files from different applciations
#  will result in undefined actions, and possibly errors.
#  after loading a run.xml file, you can still enter new values into
#  the rappture gui and continue simulation experiments.
#
#  RUN AS FOLLOWS:
#    rerun <runFile>,...
#
#      <runFile>      - the run.xml file containing an output
#                       section you would like to re-generate.
#      ...            - optional comma separated list of runFiles
#
#
#   ex: rerun run1234.xml,run5678.xml,run0123.xml

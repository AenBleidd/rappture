    * Created legend for xy plots.  You can raise/lower/show/hide/rename
      traces (curves).  There is also a provision for displaying the
      fill area between two curves and taking the average of two or
      more curves.
    * Nanovis markers now change the transfer function globally. Previously
      changing the a marker changes the transfer function for that volume
      only.  Now all volumes using that transfer function are affected.
    * Pymolproxy changed to use file transfer for PDB files.  This should 
      prevent large datasets from breaking pymol.
    * Data sent to render servers now made in one write. Should improve
      performance for large datasets.
    * Nanovis server was profiled and improvements made to protocol.
    * "Abort" button fixed.  Previous version abort was disabled during
      simulation.
    * New checkbutton indicator for booleanentry (switch).
    * Empty sequences (pymol) are now checked.
    * Fixed heightmap (surface plot) grid to accurately measure the surface.
    * added bohr units and conversion to meters
    * added a free text label so users can label each element of a sequence.
    * added example using Ruby's Rappture bindings.
    * changed boolean widget to use a simple checkbutton 
    * added ability to set the color of integer and number widgets
      to a wavelength or range of wavelengths.
